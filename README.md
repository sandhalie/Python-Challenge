Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

The project is to create a Python script to analyse the financial results of a company (PyBank) and the voting results of a rural U.S. town (PyPoll). Pybank script will go through the data and display results such as the total months, average change, and the greatest increase and decrease of the average change and which month this occurred. PyPoll will go through the data and provide information such as the total number of votes, the number of votes for each candidate and the winner. These Python scripts will also export a text file that includes the results. It was challenging to create a script that can run through 369,700 rows without printing each line for debugging purposes. Improving the readability of the next step of improving this project.

PyBank: This file contains the main python script (main.py) and two folders named Analysis and Resources. The python script will analyse the CSV file in the Resources folder and save the analysis results as a text file in the folder named Analysis. 
PyPoll: This file contains the main python script (main.py) and two folders named Analysis and Resources. The python script will analyse the CSV file in the Resources folder and save the analysis results as a text file in the folder named Analysis.
